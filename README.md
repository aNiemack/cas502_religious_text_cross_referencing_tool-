# cas502_religious_text_cross_referencing_tool-
# Team: Andrew Niemack and Joshua Carlin
# This tool is for taking databases of words from several different religious texts for the purpose of cross-referencing use of words that are related to one another. This tool will draw on databases of both scriptural and extra-scriptural sources to compare and contrast usage of words to both inform and verify the reliability of the translation. Beyond translational use, it would also help inform any study in comparative religion to see how each culture and language treats similar and different concepts.
