Andrew and Josh met over zoom to set up the dependency management. Andrew
has previous experience in coding and working with GitHub, so our 
teamwork consisted of Josh doing it and Andrew helping him when he wasn't 
sure what the next step was. 

There were no issues with creating the requirements.txt and pushing it to
GitHub. Andrew then downloaded some dependency packages for creating a 
website that he then added to the requirements text file. There was an 
issue with trying to run python in GitBash so Josh downloaded the latest 
version in order to try doing it in the Shell. It still hasn't quite 
worked, but Josh is hoping to figure it out for a later task of reading
xml files in python and adding that to the website for the research tool. 
There were no issues with committing the .gitignore for the virtual 
environment.
